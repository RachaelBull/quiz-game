## **User and Creator Stories**

**User Goals**

- As a user, I would want to be able to easily understand what this quiz is for/about
- As a user, I would want the game to be attractive and well styled
- As a user, I would want to easily be able to navigate my way around this quiz
- As a user, I would want to feel a more personalized experience whilst taking part in the quiz, such as an entered name being addressed throughout the game
- As a user, I would expect a quiz to track my progress throughout the game, acknowledging which questions the score reflects upon
- As a user, I would like to feel challenged but not too pressured. For example, having a timer but not a timer that would be so short it would deter me from playing again
- As a user, I would like to have the option to restart the game, without having to enter my details again

**Creator Goals**

- As a creator, I want to provide a warm and attractive landing page to entice the user the stay on the page
- As a creator, I want to ensure the instructions and landing information section is clear and concise to the user
- As a creator, I want to make sure that my content is relevant and interesting
- As a creator, I want my interactive features such as score keeping and the countdown to be clearly stated and easily navigated
- As a creator, I want the user to easily be able to play again
- As a creator, I want the user to feel as though the game is personalized to them such as using the entered name throughout the game and keeping personal scores

As this is aimed to be a small bit of fun for users, I would hope that users who have completed the game and enjoyed it would be likely inclined to come back. I plan to achieve this by making the contents of my live project relevant and interesting.
Also that every element and aspect of the page carefully complement each other by being easily accessible, easy to read and features very easy to navigate.

**Returning visitor expectations**

- As a returning visitor, I would expect my visit to be as enjoyable as the last, if not more.
- As a returning visitor, I would expect my visit to contain relevant content related to the game title and description
- As a returning visitor after a longer period of time, I would expect updated content and structure to the live project, for example, more questions or different questions containing the same relevance, making it more exciting for a past user to return.

## **Scope Plane** ##

In order to achieve these goals both from a user and creator perspective, I intent to include the following features:

- A landing page start area, featuring an attractive and easy on the eye background image
- A rules and information section within the landing start page, containing brief but understandable text to prepare the user to play the quiz
- An input field where the user can enter a personalized name which will be carried throughout the rest of the game
- A submit style button which will display a new section to the user in the event of a click
- A quiz section featuring the personalized name located at the top
- A scorekeeping area located just under the users personalized name
- A 12 second countdown timer located underneath the score keeping area
- A question is featured underneath the timer
- 4 answer selection choices located under the question
- A pop up alert message once an answer is clicked, displaying a short message containing whether the answer was correct or not
- A Next button located underneath the answer selections, taking the user to a new question upon the event of a click
- Upon all questions being answered, a conclusion section will be displayed offering the user to play again in the form of a button, taking the user back to the start of the quiz once clicked

## **Structure Plane** ##

Since this project was first introduced I knew that I wanted to build a project game upon my own ideas. This for me, drove me to work at a fuller potention as I picked a topic that I am very passionate about, that being music. I aim for this project to be interesting
and eyecatching, I will achieve this by keeping the questions hard but not too hard. Hard enough that the user will have to take a few seconds to think about the answer but not too hard that the user will become uninterested and leave the game before it is completed.
I decided that the best way to keep my project game consistant and attractive was to feature a nice background picture which gets carried along to every section and event within the game. I styled the sections boxes and borders in accordance to the background image
colours - opting for darker more transparent backgrounds with white text to make it attravtive and easily readable for the user.

The colors my project consists of are:

- Light Grey - to replace the background colour if the background was to fail to load up
- Black - colour of the section and button borders
- White - used for some text colours throughout the project
- Dark Grey - used with a transparency effect as the background colour for the section areas
- Off White - used as the background colour for most of the buttons across the project
- Red - used as some button background colours to display incorrect answers

## **Surface Plane** ##

**Features that are presented across the project:**

*The Landing/Information Area*

![](docs/game-landing.png)

- The landing and information area/page is the first thing the user will be presented with when loading up the page.
- The features on this may sit just ontop of the background image, the scenery and colouring of this picture was carefully selected to create a sense of warmth and comfortability to the page upon the user first entering.

![](docs/landing-mobile.png)

- Above is the landing and information page adjusted to mobile view. Which tries to keep all elements in place just sligntly adjusted more in length and size to fit the screen sizing through media querys.

![](docs/game-heading.png)

- Above is the header that is also displayed upon the user first entering the website. The font used here was 'Lato' taken from Google Fonts. I chosen to use this font as it has a much softer look to it than some other fonts. And as stated earlier, I was aiming for
the game to have a softer more comfortable feel to it. The heading text content is very clear and self explanatory as to what subject the quiz is based upon and what is to be expected within the content of the rest of the game. The heading coloring is set to white
as mostly everything surrounding the heading is coloured quite dark - this makes it more visable and enables the header to stand out better, making it much more easily readble to the user and therefore creating a better user experience. An uppsercase text transform
has been applied the heading to seperate the heading from the rest of the text contents without having to change any coloring or font styles - keeping the more simple and softer look.

![](docs/game-rules.png)

- The landing page also contains a small information/rules area before any inputs and submittions are made. The text within this small area is factual, brief but very easily understandable. This area explains to the user how they are expected to play the game and
informs the user on what features they should expect if they are to progress past this page.

![](docs/game-input.png)

- Underneath the game rules and information area, the user will be very clearly presented with an input field with a label guiding the user to enter a username which will be carried through to the rest of the game. To make the input a field more understandable
there is some placeholder text within the input field to prompt the user to fill in their name before progressing onto the submit button which will be presented underneath the input field. Above the input field there is an underlined statement asking the user to enter their chosen name. This text is white to flow nicely with the rest of the page styles and to keep the page looking clean, pristine and tidy. An uppercase text transform has been applied to this with an underlining styling to highlight the importance of this feild being completed without the need to change any fonts or colouring of the text to create the same desired effect.

![](docs/testing-input.png)

- Here the user won't be able to progress any further through the website and the game until they have filled out the required input box.

![](docs/game-submit.png)

- Placed closely underneath the input field is the submit button which will take the user to the start of the quiz upon the event of a click and the field being filled out correctly. The styling of this button is also soft, still using the same font as the rest of the page to keep that soft, simple and clean look throughout the page. However, the background colour has been ever so slighly changed to an off white/ light grey color and the text set darker to black. This was the give the user something a little different to look at to stand the button out from the rest of the contents without having to add any new dramatic colourings to the page that aren't already being used at some point in the page.

*Quiz Area*

![](docs/game-quiz.png)

- Once the submit button has been clicked, the user will be taken to the quiz section of the page and the starting instructions area will become hidden. Below will be the listed features of the quiz area:

![](docs/quiz-name.png)

- The first part of the section that the user will see is the personailsed username section that will take the user input from the input field from the previous section and display it at the top of the page throughout the rest of the game. Below this is also the scorekeeping section, which will go up in numbers everytime the user gets answers a question correctly or incorrectly. The text here is set to uppercase and is slightly bigger than the question text, making it easily visible if the user wishes to keep checking up on their score throughout the game.

![](docs/game-timer.png)

- Just below the personalised username and score keeping section, the user will be presented with a timer that counts down from 12 seconds. This timer is located in the center of the section - making it easy for the user to keep track of the time without struggle of locating it on the page. The timer is presented quite big so that it's visible to the user, but not too big that it would cause the user to become stressed or pressured, resulting in a better user experience.

![](docs/game-question.png)

- Below the timer a question is presented the user in a numbered order. This text style for the question is set to lowercase to try and create a softer more chilled approach rather than a rushed and pressured approach which I feared would be the case had I have used capitalized lettering. The questions run from 1-9 depending on what stage you are at in the quiz. A different question of a different topic or era is presented at each completion to the previous question, until the user has reached the end. The question text sizing is set slightly smaller than the contents just above, to again create a more chilled approach and not force the user to feel pressured.
  
![](docs/game-answers.png)

- Under the question the user will be given 4 option boxes to choose from. These are kept breif and simple with not too much text as the user doesn't have a lot of time to answer the question. The background colour of the option boxes are set to white and the text to back just to break up the page a little and give a clear indication to the user that these answers are to be selected.

*Below are the explained features of the timer and option buttons combined:*

![](docs/game-explained.png)

- Shown above is showing some of the game functions happening once the timer runs to 0 and once an answer is answered correctly or incorrectly - this will be explained part by part past this point.

![](docs/timer-scores.png)

- Once the timer hits 0 the incorrect score tally will automatically go up by 1 as the user didn't select an answer within the stated time period. This particular function also takes place when the user selects an incorrect answer.

![](docs/timer-answers.png)

- After the timer runs down to 0 without an answer being selected the answer options will automatically have their backgrounds turn red and the text turn white - except for the correct answer option, this one will keep the original styling. Once an answer has been selected within the time frame given the answer options will also take this form. The red indicated to the user that 3 of the 4 options were incorrect and the one left alone was the correct answer. Just incase this isn't all that clear to the user a pop up has been added that the user can read for confirmation before the buttons take their correct or incorrect colouring state, avoiding assuming that the user is familiar with quiz based games.

![](docs/incorrect-popup.png)
![](docs/correct-popup.png)

- One of these popups will be shown to the user upon an answer selection before the answer options take their incorrect or correct colour state. The first incorrect statement will be alerted to the user at the top of the page if an answer has been chosen incorrectly, clearly letting the user know how they answered the question and how to expect the tally to look like upon submitting the answer and moving onto the next, and the same will apply if the user answered correctly, except the second message will be displayed to the user instead.

![](docs/timer-next.png)

- The next button needed for the user to click to progress further through the questions of the quiz will be presented only once the user has selected an answer or the timer has ran out and has closed the pop up message that will appear at the top. This clearly tells the user that the questions have to be answered whilst on that same page and that the questions cannot be skipped through. This button is set to hidden until this event takes place.

![](docs/game-ending.png)

- Once the user reaches question 9 and has clicked the next button they will be taken to this page which acts like a conclusion section, clearly displaying the users selected name and tally results of how many questions were answered correctly and incorrectly. The next button is then slightly changed - the text is changed to 'Give it another shot?' telling the user that if they so wish, they can try the quiz again.

With further knowledge and experience I would like to expland onto this project and add more complicated features such as a player against computer mechanism.

**User Stories Testing**

- As a user, I would want to be able to easily understand what this quiz is for/about:
The home page acts as a simple introduction to the project to inform the user of the project purpose and some basic instructions - getting the user ready for the quiz.
- As a user, I would want the game to be attractive and well styled:
The colors and font used on the project were designed to be simple and easy to read, with a focus on simplicity over design. The hero image in the background is also simple yet visually appealing to the user.
- As a user, I would want to feel a more personalized experience whilst taking part in the quiz, such as an entered name being addressed throughout the game:
The user is asked to input a username before beginning the quiz, with some HTML validation to make sure no empty inputs are passed. The user is then shown their user name through the quiz to provide a more personalized experience.
- As a user, I would expect a quiz to track my progress throughout the game, acknowledging which questions the score reflects upon:
The user is constantly shown how many questions they have answered correct and incorrect, so that they are constantly aware of the progress through the quiz.
- As a user, I would like to feel challenged but not too pressured. For example, having a timer but not a timer that would be so short it would deter me from playing again:
A timer of 12 seconds is set for the user to answer a question. If no answer is selected then the question is marked as incorrect. This timer was based on user feedback, as it would allow the user enough time to read the question and think about an answer, whilst also allowing the user to proceed through the course in a timely manner.
- As a user, I would like to have the option to restart the game, without having to enter my details again:
When the quiz ends, the user is shown the correct score and has the option to play the quiz again without having to go through the process of adding a user name again.
Something else that was also added to the project based on user feedback was a simple browser alert to allow users to understand if the answer is correct or incorrect - avoiding the assumption that the user is familiar with quizzes. Although there is a CSS class being added to incorrect answers after an answer is picked, I felt the alert added something for potentially visually impaired users.

## **Bugs** ##

At the start of the project I came across an error which took the user to an error page once the form was submitted. I resolved this by preventing the default actions in my javascript code to allow the user to move easily through to the next displayed section in the project.

*Timer bug and fixed solution*

![](docs/fixed-timer.png)
Here the console was showing an error for hiding the stop countdown function. My solution to this was to hide the HTML rather than the function and the HTML element that the timer was wrongly incremementing on the play again page.

![](docs/fixed-function.png)
Here the countdown function was being called in multiple places, causing the timer to bug out if the user was to click the play again button as there was more than one event taking place regarding the function.

![](docs/fixed-events.png)
Here I fixed the countdown function solution by calling the function within event listeners rather than within section loads, preventing the timer multiple call bugs and stopping the incremementing scores when the user was not playing.
