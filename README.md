- As a user, I would expect a quiz to track my progress throughout the game, acknowledging which questions the score reflects upon

**Creator Goals**

- As a creator, I want the user to easily be able to play again
- As a creator, I want the user to feel as though the game is personalized to them such as using the entered name throughout the game and keeping personal scores

As this is aimed to be a small bit of fun for users, I would hope that users who have completed the game and enjoyed it would be likely inclined to come back. I plan to achieve this by making the contents of my live project relevant and interesting.
Also that every element and aspect of the page carefully complement each other by being easily accessible, easy to read and features very easy to navigate.

**Returning visitor expectations**

- As a returning visitor, I would expect my visit to be as enjoyable as the last, if not more.
- As a returning visitor, I would expect my visit to contain relevant content related to the game title and description
- As a returning visitor after a longer period of time, I would expect updated content and structure to the live project, for example, more questions or different questions containing the same relevance, making it more exciting for a past user to return.

## **Scope Plane** ##

In order to achieve these goals both from a user and creator perspective, I intent to include the following features:

- A landing page start area, featuring an attractive and easy on the eye background image
- A rules and information section within the landing start page, containing brief but understandable text to prepare the user to play the quiz
- An input field where the user can enter a personalized name which will be carried throughout the rest of the game
- A submit style button which will display a new section to the user in the event of a click
- A quiz section featuring the personalized name located at the top
- A scorekeeping area located just under the users personalized name
- A 12 second countdown timer located underneath the score keeping area
- A question is featured underneath the timer
- 4 answer selection choices located under the question
- A pop up alert message once an answer is clicked, displaying a short message containing whether the answer was correct or not
- A Next button located underneath the answer selections, taking the user to a new question upon the event of a click
- Upon all questions being answered, a conclusion section will be displayed offering the user to play again in the form of a button, taking the user back to the start of the quiz once clicked
