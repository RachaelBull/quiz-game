            <p>
                In this game you will be presented with 10 general music related questions. This will be you vs Bob.
                You have 12 seconds to answer each question. If you answer the question correctly and before the timer 
                you will gain a point which will be recorded just below the game. However, if you answer incorrectly within the time
                or don't submit an answer within the 12 seconds - then the question will be passed to music expert Bob (or so he thinks!)
                where he will then also have 12 seconds to answer the question. 
                <br>
                Answer surely and timely - Bob will not go easy on you!
